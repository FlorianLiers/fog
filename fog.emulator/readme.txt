The emulator uses the following packet structure:

 Layer 2a (Ehernet):
    entry                         |     size
    -------------------------------------------------    
    Destination MAC address       |    6 bytes
    Source MAC address            |    6 bytes
    Ether type                    |    2 bytes = "0x606"
       
 Layer 2b (FoG LLC):
    entry                         |     size
    -------------------------------------------------    
    Fragmentation flags           |    1 byte
       
 Layer 3 (FoG):
    entry                         |     size
    -------------------------------------------------    
    Header length                 |    2 bytes            
    Markings                      |    2 bytes
    Loop counter                  |    2 bytes
    Payload length                |    4 bytes
    Route length                  |    4 bytes
    Route                         |    >= 1 bytes / variable    

 Ether type:
  The range between 1501 and 1535 is undefined in standard, values <= 1500 are reserved for backward compatibility to Ethernet I and represent the packet size.
  A value below 0x600 (1536D) indicates an Ethernet I packet. We use 0x606 as ether type, which is unused till now. The lowest used value is 0x800, which is
  used for the Internet Protocol v4.
